                            My name is Adam Lopez, I graduated Ironhack coding bootcamp in Miami, Florida. While at Ironhack, I was challenged with learning how to code in eight weeks and succeeded by being one of the top five in my class. Ironhack has helped me to look at design patterns with an unbiased opinion toward any frameworks, and has sparked my passion for learning Object Oriented Design.
                            <br /> <br />
                            As difficult as it was, I caught on quickly to a sink or swim learning style that I was used to working in retail. We learned several frameworks and tools including Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
                            <br /> <br />
                            After leaving the bootcamp and coming back to Tampa, FL, I found myself in another sink or swim moment as there were no positions hiring in my area for a Ruby on Rails developer, this was a deep .NET zone. Taking the quick learning I used at Ironhack, I picked up PHP and MySQL going more into the LAMP Stack Developer role.
                            <br /> <br />
                            It's been a long time since the bootcamp, and I have worked my way up from many places and met a lot of really cool, super smart developers. I am grateful for the journey I am on and am looking forward to what the next opportunities bring.
                            <br /> <br />
                            To keep my skills sharp, I currently am using Udemy and other coding websites to further my knowledge of programming languages. I am open to collaborative projects, reach out and make sure you have your water!
